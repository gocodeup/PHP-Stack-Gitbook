# Operating Systems

## Overview

You probably already know what an operating system is because you have used one or more for a while. Wikipedia describes an operating system as follows:

>An operating system (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is an essential component of the system software in a computer system. Application programs usually require an operating system to function.

### 32 bit vs 64 bit

The terms 32 bit or 64 bit refer to the physical architecture of the CPU, and how it handles data. You have probably noticed there are different versions of software (including operating systems) for 32 bit or 64 bit systems. Generally, 32 bit software will run on a 64 bit machine, but 64 bit software will not run on a 32 bit machine. There are exceptions, but for the best results, choose the software that matches the computer hardware you are running on.

For our class, we will be running the latest version Mac OSX, and on the first day of class, we will help you install a virtual machine running a version of Linux on your machine. We will also walk you through being able to load that other operating system and help you understand why we are using two operating systems instead of one. For now, all you have to understand is that you need a Mac, and we will build from there.
