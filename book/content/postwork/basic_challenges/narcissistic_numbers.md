# Narcissistic Numbers

A narcissistic number is a non-negative integer (*n*) with *m* digits where the sum of all the individual digits  raised to the power *m* is equal to *n*.

For example:

If *n* is **153**, then *m* (the number of digits) is **3** and:

> 1<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> = 1 + 125 + 27 = **153**

So, 153 is a narcissistic number.

**Objective**: Write a script to generate and output the first 25 narcissistic integers.
